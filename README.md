# Yahiita


[Yahiita](https://github.com/prototexh/yahiita) is yet another high intensity interval training app. What it does do differently is provide a very high level of customization of the training program..

Yahiita is commercial software (not open source). [Yahiita on GitHub](https://github.com/prototexh/yahiita) supports collaboration between its developer, and its *user community*, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect feedback and discuss future direction. This is a one person project, and while that does have it's limitations, you alteast know that your feedback is heard and acted upon.

You can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, or this GitHub issue tracker. 

As a developer I want to make Yahiita perfect. I welcome all user ideas and opinions.
